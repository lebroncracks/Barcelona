              • Camp Nou is the iconic home of FC Barcelona and holds a rich history dating back to the 1950s.<br>
              <br>
              • Construction of the stadium began on March 28, 1954, to accommodate the club’s growing fanbase.<br>
              <br>
              • It was designed by architects Francesc Mitjans and Josep Soteras.<br>
              <br>
              • Officially opened on September 24, 1957, with a seating capacity of approximately 93,000.<br>
              <br>
              • In the 1970s and 80s, it was expanded and hosted historic events like the 1982 FIFA World Cup and the 1992 Olympics.<br>
              <br>
              • The 1990s saw modernizations such as media boxes, VIP areas, and improved lighting.<br>
              <br>
              • The “Dream Team” era under Johan Cruyff made Camp Nou a football fortress.<br>
              <br>
              • In 2014, FC Barcelona approved the Espai Barça project to renovate the stadium completely.<br>
              <br>

              <br>
              • The new Camp Nou, expected in 2026, will feature a retractable roof, smart technology, and over 105,000 seats.<br>
              <br>
              • It remains the largest stadium in Europe and a symbol of Catalan pride and football greatness.<br>
